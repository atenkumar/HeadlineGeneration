       "'JACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- The Jacksonville Jaguars are pleased with how Leonard Fournette has begun his offseason and are eager to see how the third-year player responds to a disappointing -- and at times concerning -- 2018. General manager Dave Caldwell and coach Doug Marrone each praised Fournette at the NFL scouting combine on Wednesday morning. \"I think Leonard\\'s in a good spot,\" Caldwell said. \"I know a lot was made out of the end-of-the-season stuff, but he seems like he\\'s in a good phase. He\\'s working out. I know he\\'s taking his nutrition and his workout seriously. I think he\\'s in a good spot, so we\\'ll see when he comes in April with the rest of the veterans and in the OTAs.\" Fournette\\'s second NFL season didn\\'t go nearly as well as his first, when he rushed for 1,040 yards and nine touchdowns to help the Jaguars win the AFC South and reach the AFC Championship game. Instead, in 2018, he missed seven games because of injuries, was suspended for another, had several off-field issues and let himself get out of shape. The Jaguars need a quarterback, but they also could use a tight end, some line help and another receiver or two in the draft in April. There could be big changes in New England this offseason. The Jets, meanwhile, have money to spend, and everyone is still chasing the Pats. The season ended on a sour note when executive VP of football operations Tom Coughlin publicly criticized Fournette, who was inactive because of a foot injury, and T.J. Yeldon for sitting alone on the bench and acting disinterested during the season finale. Coughlin said they were \"disrespectful, selfish, and their behavior was unbecoming that of a professional football player.\" There was mounting frustration inside the organization after Fournette missed six full games and half of two others with a right hamstring injury in the first half of the season. The Jaguars built the offense around a power running game, and the offense had a hard time functioning consistently without him on the field. All that time away apparently impacted his conditioning, too. He ended the season heavier than when he reported for training camp at 223 pounds -- his lowest weight since his sophomore season at LSU. It\\'s unusual for an NFL player to gain weight during the season, and Fournette was unable to do much, if any, conditioning while he was rehabbing his hamstring. After the second half of the season, Fournette admitted in December that he could be in better shape. He also was suspended without pay for leaving the bench and fighting with Buffalo Bills defensive lineman Shaq Lawson during the Jaguars\\' 24-21 loss on Nov. 25. Fournette said he ran across the field because he saw Lawson shove Carlos Hyde and wanted to defend his teammate. The Jaguars voided the remaining guarantees in Fournette\\'s contract as punishment, but Fournette has appealed to the NFL Players Association and the NFL. Fournette also was caught on video yelling that he was going to \"beat your ass\" at an unknown fan in the stands during the team\\'s embarrassing loss to Tennessee on Dec. 6. Fournette, who was escorted away, said several days later that a fan used a racial slur, a claim that Yeldon corroborated. Fournette finished his second season with 439 rushing yards and five touchdowns, averaging just 3.3 yards per carry in the eight games in which he played. It is the first time he has failed to record at least one 100-yard game in a season dating to before his time at St. Augustine (Louisiana) High School. Marrone and Fournette had a clear-the-air meeting after the season ended, and Marrone said Wednesday that he believes Fournette has responded the way he would have liked. \"I think last year, obviously, was tough with the injuries,\" Marrone said. \"I think any time that you\\'re young and you have a lot of expectations put on you, I think when you have some injuries, it\\'s tough to deal with. It\\'s a tough situation for anyone, not just Leonard. \"I think after the season was over, obviously, it\\'s been noted that we sat down and spoke, he and I. And I really believe he\\'s in a good place. He\\'s been in the building. He\\'s been working out. Working hard. ... So I believe him, and I\\'m excited for him when he comes back.\" To help make this website better, to improve and personalize your experience and for advertising purposes, are you happy to accept cookies and other technologies?'"
