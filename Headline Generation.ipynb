      "Adam Schefter breaks down Saints owner Gayle Benson's comments about the controversial missed pass interference call in New Orleans' loss to the Rams. (0:58)\n",
      "METAIRIE, La. -- New Orleans Saints fans are having their say.\n",
      "After a stunning missed call by officials helped to keep the Saints out of the Super Bowl, angry fans have been reacting in various ways -- from lawsuits and petitions, to billboards in Atlanta, to boycotts throughout the New Orleans area, to a letter from Louisiana's governor that chastised NFL commissioner Roger Goodell.\n",
      "In the wake of the no-call that helped decide Sunday's NFC Championship Game, the NFL will discuss whether to make pass-interference penalties reviewable, a source confirmed to ESPN.\n",
      "Sunday's no-call in the NFC championship game shows us why it's time for the NFL to make pass interference a reviewable play.\n",
      "Sean Payton said the NFL's head of officials told him the officials \"blew the call\" by not penalizing the Los Angeles Rams for pass interference late in the fourth quarter of Sunday's NFC Championship Game.\n",
      "At least two lawsuits have been filed by local attorneys on behalf of Saints fans who want to compel Goodell to use his power under the NFL rulebook to replay the final 1 minute, 49 seconds of regulation of New Orleans' overtime loss to the Los Angeles Rams in Sunday's NFC Championship Game.\n",
      "Meanwhile, Saints fan Matt Bowers has rented billboards in and around the Atlanta area -- where Super Bowl LIII is being held -- to voice his displeasure with the league.\n",
      "\"And I'm not done yet,\" Bowers, who owns car dealerships throughout the Southeast, told ESPN. \"I'm going to do my best to bring as much attention to this as possible -- and I'm not going to stop until I make them miserable.\"\n",
      "Saints running back Alvin Kamara was among those who supported Bowers' cause on social media.\n",
      "MY BOYYYYY @Matthew_Bowers_ üï∫üèæ https://t.co/8h8tiTPgzs\n",
      "Several New Orleans-area bars and restaurants have already vowed to have anti-Super Bowl parties by refusing to show the championship game. One local bakery was selling cookies with the face of referee Bill Vinovich with a red slash through it. And local businesses throughout the area have posted signs with clever references to the botched call.\n",
      "Also, a petition that started on Change.org to replay the game had nearly 600,000 signatures as of Tuesday afternoon.\n",

      "Fans (and some Saints players) clamoring for a rematch have pointed to an obscure NFL rule that deals with \"Extraordinarily Unfair Acts.\"\n",
      "According to Rule 17, Section 2, Article 1, the NFL commissioner has the \"sole authority to investigate and take appropriate disciplinary and/or corrective measures if any club action, non-participant interference, or calamity occurs in an NFL game which the Commissioner deems so extraordinarily unfair or outside the accepted tactics encountered in professional football that such action has a major effect on the result of the game.\"\n",
      "However, Article 2 states, \"The Commissioner will not apply authority in cases of complaints by clubs concerning judgmental errors or routine errors of omission by game officials. Games involving such complaints will continue to stand as completed.\"\n",
      "The Saints have taken no formal action against the league so far, but owner Gayle Benson released a statement Monday saying she has \"been in touch with the NFL regarding yesterday's events and will aggressively pursue changes in NFL policies to ensure no team and fan base is ever put in a similar position again.\"\n",
      "In her statement, Benson added: \"It is a disservice to our coaches, players, employees and, most importantly, the fans who make our game possible. The NFL must always commit to providing the most basic of expectations -- fairness and integrity.\"\n",
      "Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards sent a letter Tuesday to Goodell to express the \"deep disappointment'' of the people of Louisiana and Saints fans.\n",
      "\"The very least that any fan of the Saints, or any other team, should be able to expect from any game is that the result will be decided by the players on the field,'' Edwards wrote. \"By missing the obvious, blatant and intentional penalty at the end of the game, the referees in Sunday's game undermined that expectation and unfortunately were allowed to determine the winner.\"\n",
      "Edwards is calling on the NFL to make rule changes for next season that would allow for expanding replay reviews. He said without such adjustments, \"the very integrity of the game will be called into question.''\n",
      "And the governor told Goodell that while Louisiana football fans will move past the game, \"we will not forget it.''\n",
      "Neither the NFL nor Saints coach Sean Payton has addressed the media following Payton's postgame news conference, during which he revealed that the NFL's head of officials, Alberto Riveron, called him immediately after the game and admitted the officials \"blew\" the call.\n",
      "ESPN's Adam Schefter and The Associated Press contributed to this report.\n",

       " \"Biggest issue in 2018: This question is relative, and the ranking is a bit misleading. QBR takes into account an entire season, and Mayfield had two distinct experiences for the Browns -- first with Todd Haley as offensive coordinator and then with Freddie Kitchens in that role. Under Haley in Weeks 1-8, Mayfield had a QBR of 35.8, which ranked 31st of 33 qualifiers. From Week 9 on, though, Mayfield's QBR was 70.1, which ranked seventh. For Mayfield, the biggest issue didn't seem to be his play or ability, but the approach and plays called. Placed in a system that eliminated seven-step drops and long routes and gave him the chance to get rid of the ball quickly and play fast, Mayfield responded like the first overall pick in the draft is expected to respond.\",\n",
       " \"How he can improve in 2019: Grow. Pure and simple. Continue to build off what he did with Kitchens, who is now the Browns' head coach, and to grow as a player and person. It's what's expected of any dedicated player going into his second season. Mayfield also can improve on some of the factors that went into his final QBR. First were his turnovers. He threw 14 interceptions and lost three fumbles; those 17 turnovers were tied for the third most in the league, according to ESPN Stats & Information research. In addition, his completion percentage (for the season) was 24th (63.8 percent), and he was not in the top 10 in some of the positive ratings categories (touchdowns per attempt, yards per attempt and others), per ESPN Stats & Info. QBR also takes into account how well a quarterback performs at key points in games; it might be interesting to know what Mayfield's QBR would have been had he completed that final drive against Baltimore.\",\n",
       " 'He said it: \"He has a lot more football left in him. He is still a rookie. There are still a lot of nuances of the National Football League. He threw three interceptions [in the finale in Baltimore]. He can still work on those little things and understanding of certain things. He also broke an NFL record [for touchdown passes by a rookie] as well, so you applaud him for that. You would hope that he can grow exponentially, and by Year 3, he is what we all thought he would be.\" -- Browns general manager John Dorsey',\n",

       " \"Biggest issue in 2018: Allen's 56.2 percent completion rate at Wyoming was scrutinized during the pre-draft process but foretold his 52.8 rate as a rookie in the NFL, raising questions about his accuracy. Among quarterbacks with as many pass attempts (320) as Allen in a season, it was the worst completion rate in the NFL since Blaine Gabbert's 50.9 percent in 2011. The Bills defended Allen's college stat by pointing to his lack of a supporting cast and the difficulty of his throws. Both arguments could apply to his first professional season. An undrafted rookie, Robert Foster, led the team with 436 receiving yards on passes thrown by Allen, while 4.1 percent of Allen's passes (10th-most in the NFL) were dropped by his receivers. Only three quarterbacks over the past 10 seasons -- Tim Tebow in 2011, Drew Stanton in 2014 and Jameis Winston in 2018 -- averaged more air yards per pass than Allen (10.54) in his first season. Some of the accuracy issues still can be pinned on Allen; a league-high 23.7 percent of his attempts (excluding throwaways and spikes) were off target, according to ESPN Stats & Information.\",\n",
       " \"How he can improve in 2019: Allen had a knack as a rookie for making hard throws look easy and easy throws look hard. He completed a league-low 64.6 percent of his throws that traveled five air yards or less and was off target on a league-high 14.2 percent of those passes, per ESPN Stats & Information. The relative inability for Allen to execute a short, rhythmic passing game put stress on the offense, as did Allen holding the ball longer than any other qualifying NFL quarterback. He averaged 3.22 seconds before his passes, which was second only to Tebow's 3.35-second average in 2011 in the past 10 seasons. Allen too often looked for the home run as a passer and will need to take coaching that makes him more comfortable and capable of hitting singles and doubles. Expected improvements to the offensive line and skill positions could help, but Allen will need to take steps forward himself.\",\n",
       " 'He said it: \"He\\'s not arrived by any means. There\\'s going to be things when he steps out next year that somebody else is going to get him on. But I know who he is, and he is not complacent or anything like that. This guy is competitive, this guy wants to get better, wants to be the best at his craft, and I know he\\'s got a really good plan.

Only two quarterbacks (Case Keenum and Derek Carr) started 16 games and threw for fewer touchdowns. With Manning, everything needs to be perfect for success at this point of his career. The combination of his offensive line struggling in the first half of the season with his immobility was crippling. Manning was sacked 31 times in the first eight games and threw one touchdown pass under pressure during a 1-7 start. He produced a first down on 13 percent of his dropbacks under pressure in the first half of the season. The NFL average during that span was 19 percent.\",\n",
       " \"How he can improve in 2019: If Manning returns for another season -- the Giants haven't publicly committed to that yet -- the hope is he can build off the second half of 2018, when he was a passenger rather than the conductor. New York relied more heavily on Saquon Barkley and the running game and asked Manning to do less. It slowed down the pressure and resulted in Manning throwing 13 of his 21 TD passes. He had a passer rating of 87.8 over the final eight games compared with 53.1 in the first eight games. Manning's physical skills aren't going to improve at 38 years old, but his efficiency can if the Giants ask him to do less.\",\n",

       " 'Biggest issue in 2018: Choose one: a leaky offensive line that saw Carr sacked a career-high 51 times (he took 36 sacks combined in 2016 and 2017); no speedy playmakers at receiver (the inconsistent Amari Cooper was traded Oct. 22); a steep learning curve in Jon Gruden\\'s back-to-the-future offense (dink, dunk, bomb?). It truly was a baptism by fire for Carr, who entered the season with many people simply wondering how he would react to Gruden\\'s oft fire-and-brimstone coaching approach. Having a pair of rookie tackles in first-rounder Kolton Miller protecting his blind side and third-rounder Brandon Parker also had to test the confidence of Carr, who has suffered a broken right (passing) finger, a fractured right fibula and three broken bones in his back since Dec. 24, 2016. He admitted to \"taking inventory\" after big hits, although the quarterback did improve in the second half of the season.',\n",
       " \"How he can improve in 2019: A more buttoned-up O-line, a speedy No. 1 receiver and a threat at running back to open up the play-action game would do wonders. Though perhaps simply a second season with Gruden will produce a bounty. Consider: The only other time Carr played in the same system for a second consecutive year, in 2016, he played at a league MVP level. Then there's this -- after throwing seven touchdowns and eight interceptions in the Raiders' first six games, Carr had 12 TDs and two INTs after the bye, the TD-INT ratio of 6.0 the fourth best in the NFL in Weeks 8-17. He also had a streak of 332 passes without a pick, the third-longest streak in NFL history. Sure, Carr might have the third-most losses by a QB in his first five NFL seasons (his 46 career defeats are seven behind his brother David and three behind Blake Bortles), but there are some positive things to build upon.\",\n",
